# purdue-binder

This repo is for collecting Jupyter notebooks for the Purdue AI course I am taking. I want to preserve this content
outside of the learning platform for future reference. I have linked the repo to Binder so that anyone can run the
notebooks in their browser (see the badge above) without having to install anything locally.
